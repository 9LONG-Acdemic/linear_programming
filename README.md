# Optimization Methods Implementation for the Farming Stochastic Programming Model

This is a repo of a project related to linear programming from my data science graduate course, MIE1620: Linear Programming and Network Flows, at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Description

This project conducts a comparative analysis of various solution methods for a farming stochastic programming model. It examines the performance of a customized simplex method, a primal affine scaling algorithm, and an industrial strength simplex solver. The analysis includes scenario generation, methodology comparison, results, and performance evaluation, focusing on mean squared error, optimal objectives, and running times under different scenarios. The goal is to identify the most effective method for solving the farming model, considering factors like stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
